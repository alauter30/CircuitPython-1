## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Hello all! this is my long awaited descriptions on stuff I did nearly 5-6 months ago
I'll admit I am embarassingly late to the party, but at least it ain't june yet!

This is where I Learned how to write Engineering notebooks and the "Hello World!" stuff


Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
from time import sleep

while True:
    print("Hello world!")
    print("Hello world! Atticus rocks!")
    sleep(1)

```

And here is how you should give image credit to someone, if you use their work:

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Reflection
I wish I would've gotten this WAY sooner, but learning is learning.
